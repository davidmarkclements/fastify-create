> Rapidly generate a Fastify project


## Usage

There is no need to install this package directly.

```sh
npm init fastify [your_app_name]
```

The `npm init` command will find this package automatically and run it.

### Integrate

To integrate Fastify into an existing project:

```sh
npm init fastify --integrate
```

Note that this will overwrite files, so exercise caution.

Files and folders that will be overwritten by integrate mode:

* .gitignore
* app.js
* plugins
* routes
* test

The `package.json` file will not be overwritten but will be modified.

The plugins are loaded with [@fastify/autoload](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-autoload) with an empty default configuration.
